# Static Link

Static Link is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables the creation and sale of party tickets as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. The project leverages the power of smart contracts to provide a transparent and secure solution for ticket management and ownership.

## Description

The Static Link project consists of two main contracts:

1. **PaymentContract**: This contract handles the payment functionality. Users can send Ether to the contract to purchase party tickets. The payment process is securely executed on the Ethereum network, ensuring trustless transactions.

2. **PartyTicket**: This contract facilitates the creation and management of party tickets as NFTs. Each party ticket is represented as a unique token on the blockchain. The contract allows party organizers to create parties, define ticket prices, set maximum capacities, and mint tickets for specific events.
